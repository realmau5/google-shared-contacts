# Google Shared Contacts Manager

Use this tool to manage shared contacts on a Google for Work / Google App domain. You can use this to share the contact details of vendors, emergency contacts, janitorial services, colleagues or other important persons with the members of your Google Apps-domain.

This tool does NOT work with your regular GMail account, and you need to be domain admin for this tool to work. Contacts shared in this fashion will show up in _most_ phones. 

It is a self-hosted tool, meaning that you should download the source code, install the dependencies and host it yourself. This is the most privacy-friendly option.
